If you have any questions, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katiehuangx/).

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql
select s.customer_id,sum(m.price) total_sales from dannys_diner.sales s
join dannys_diner.menu m
on s.product_id=m.product_id
group by s.customer_id
order by total desc

````

#### Steps:
- Use **JOIN** to merge `dannys_diner.sales` and `dannys_diner.menu` tables as `s.customer_id` and `m.price` are from both tables.
- Use **SUM** to calculate the total sales contributed by each customer.
- Group the aggregated results by `s.customer_id`. 

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent $76.
- Customer B spent $74.
- Customer C spent $36.

***

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
select customer_id,count(distinct order_date) as visit_count from dannys_diner.sales
group by customer_id

````

#### Steps:
- To determine the unique number of visits for each customer, utilize **COUNT(DISTINCT `order_date`)**.
- It's important to apply the **DISTINCT** keyword while calculating the visit count to avoid duplicate counting of days. For instance, if Customer A visited the restaurant twice on '2021–01–07', counting without **DISTINCT** would result in 2 days instead of the accurate count of 1 day.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | visit_count |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

- Customer A visited 4 times.
- Customer B visited 6 times.
- Customer C visited 2 times.

***

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql
select b.customer_id,  b.product_name from 
(
select distinct s.customer_id, m.product_name,
rank() over(partition by customer_id order by order_date asc)as rnk
from dannys_diner.sales s
join dannys_diner.menu m
on s.product_id=m.product_id
  ) b
  where rnk=1
  order by b.customer_id asc
````

#### Steps:
- Used **Rank()** over order_date to sort the date and time
- Used **subquery,where and order by** to filter customer_id and product_name

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | curry        | 
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer A placed an order for both curry and sushi simultaneously, making them the first items in the order.
- Customer B's first order is curry.
- Customer C's first order is ramen.
***

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

````sql
with t as
(select product_id as famous from
	(
		select product_id,count(product_id) as cnt,
		rank() over(order by count(product_id) desc) as rnk
		from dannys_diner.sales
		group by product_id
	) b
where rnk=1)
select s.customer_id,m.product_name as most_purchased_item_on_menu, 
count(t.famous) no_of_times_purchased_by_each from t
join dannys_diner.sales s on s.product_id=t.famous
join dannys_diner.menu m on s.product_id=m.product_id
group by s.customer_id,m.product_name

````

#### SQL topics used:
-**CTE, SUBQUERY, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, RANK(), JOINS,**

#### Answer:
| most_purchased | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 8       | ramen |


- Most purchased item on the menu is ramen which is 8 times. Yummy!

***

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

````sql
select b.customer_id,m.product_name,b.cnt from
(
select customer_id,product_id,count(product_id) as cnt,
rank() over(partition by customer_id order by count(product_id) desc) as rnk
  from dannys_diner.sales
group by customer_id,product_id
  )b
  join dannys_diner.menu m on m.product_id=b.product_id
  where rnk=1
  order by b.customer_id
````

*Each user may have more than 1 favourite item.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |

- Customer A and C's favourite item is ramen.
- Customer B enjoys all items on the menu. He/she is a true foodie, sounds like me.

***

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

```sql
select b.customer_id,b.product_name from 
(
select s.customer_id,s.order_date,m.join_date,m1.product_name,
dense_rank() over(partition by s.customer_id order by order_date asc) as rnk
from dannys_diner.sales s
join dannys_diner.members m
on s.customer_id=m.customer_id and s.order_date>=m.join_date
join dannys_diner.menu m1
 on s.product_id=m1.product_id
  )b
  where rnk=1

```
#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | ramen        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Customer A's first order as a member is ramen.
- Customer B's first order as a member is sushi.

***

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

````sql
with t as
(
select s.customer_id,s.order_date,m.join_date,m1.product_name,
rank() over(partition by s.customer_id order by s.order_date desc) as rnk
from dannys_diner.sales s
join dannys_diner.members m
on s.customer_id=m.customer_id and s.order_date<m.join_date
join dannys_diner.menu m1
on s.product_id=m1.product_id)
select * from t where rnk=1
````

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Both customers' last order before becoming members are sushi.

***

**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**

```sql
select b.customer_id,sum(b.total_items) as total_items,sum(b.total_spent) as total_spent
from
(
select s.customer_id,count(s.product_id) as total_items,sum(m1.price) as total_spent from dannys_diner.sales s 
join dannys_diner.members m
on s.customer_id=m.customer_id and s.order_date<m.join_date
join dannys_diner.menu m1
on s.product_id=m1.product_id
group by s.customer_id,s.product_id
  )b
  group by customer_id
```

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_items | total_sales |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 3 |  40       |

Before becoming members,
- Customer A spent $25 on 2 items.
- Customer B spent $40 on 3 items.

***

**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier — how many points would each customer have?**

```sql
select b.customer_id,sum(b.points) from
(
select s.customer_id,m.product_id,m.price,
case when m.product_id=1 then m.price*20 else m.price*10 end
as points 
from dannys_diner.sales s
join dannys_diner.menu m
on s.product_id=m.product_id)b
group by b.customer_id
order by b.customer_id
```

#### Steps:
Let's break down the question to understand the point calculation for each customer's purchases.
- Each $1 spent = 10 points. However, `product_id` 1 sushi gets 2x points, so each $1 spent = 20 points.
- Here's how the calculation is performed using a conditional CASE statement:
	- If product_id = 1, multiply every $1 by 20 points.
	- Otherwise, multiply $1 by 10 points.
- Then, calculate the total points for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
| C           | 360 |

- Total points for Customer A is $860.
- Total points for Customer B is $940.
- Total points for Customer C is $360.

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi — how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**

```sql
WITH dates_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
      join_date, 
      join_date + 6 AS valid_date, 
      DATE_TRUNC(
        'month', '2021-01-31'::DATE)
        + interval '1 month' 
        - interval '1 day' AS last_date
  FROM dannys_diner.members
)

SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * menu.price
    WHEN sales.order_date BETWEEN dates.join_date AND dates.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * menu.price
    ELSE 10 * menu.price END) AS points
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dates_cte AS dates
  ON sales.customer_id = dates.customer_id
  AND dates.join_date <= sales.order_date
  AND sales.order_date <= dates.last_date
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
```

#### Assumptions:
- On Day -X to Day 1 (the day a customer becomes a member), each $1 spent earns 10 points. However, for sushi, each $1 spent earns 20 points.
- From Day 1 to Day 7 (the first week of membership), each $1 spent for any items earns 20 points.
- From Day 8 to the last day of January 2021, each $1 spent earns 10 points. However, sushi continues to earn double the points at 20 points per $1 spent.

#### Steps:
- Create a CTE called `dates_cte`. 
- In `dates_cte`, calculate the `valid_date` by adding 6 days to the `join_date` and determine the `last_date` of the month by subtracting 1 day from the last day of January 2021.
- From `dannys_diner.sales` table, join `dates_cte` on `customer_id` column, ensuring that the `order_date` of the sale is after the `join_date` (`dates.join_date <= sales.order_date`) and not later than the `last_date` (`sales.order_date <= dates.last_date`).
- Then, join `dannys_diner.menu` table based on the `product_id` column.
- In the outer query, calculate the points by using a `CASE` statement to determine the points based on our assumptions above. 
    - If the `product_name` is 'sushi', multiply the price by 2 and then by 10. For orders placed between `join_date` and `valid_date`, also multiply the price by 2 and then by 10. 
    - For all other products, multiply the price by 10.
- Calculate the sum of points for each customer.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 1020 |
| B           | 320 |

- Total points for Customer A is 1,020.
- Total points for Customer B is 320.

**Rank All The Things**

**Danny also requires further information about the ```ranking``` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ```ranking``` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.**

  SELECT 
    sales.customer_id, 
    sales.order_date,  
    menu.product_name,
